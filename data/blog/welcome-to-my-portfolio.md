## Hello World!

My name is Jesus and this is my first blog post!

Just to let you know a little more about me, I studied Games Programming at the SAE Institute in London and I finished university in 2019. After that I've been working as a System Administrator, Devops and Developer (Yes, three roles) for an IT Support Company. During this period I grew as a developer and my interest into building applications that can help people day to day grow up to the point that I joined a Swift Developer Program.

Swift Developer Program is a coding boot camp where I will learn the bits and pieces of iOS Development with Swift and Swift UI. The boot camp will finish in January and I expect to grow the skill to make wonderful apps free of bugs and crashes.

I don't have anything to show yet apart from this pretty website that I built with the help of [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Astrowind](https://astrowind.vercel.app/). Please check them out, it was fun and pretty simple to build this page and blog.

See you another time!

Happy coding!
