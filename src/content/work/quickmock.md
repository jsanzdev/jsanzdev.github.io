## Are you in need of a free mock up tool?

During my time in **Lemoncode's Masterâ€™s in Front-End Development** program, I contributed to the development of an open-source tool for creating mockups and wireframes.

This application enables users to design wireframes for **mobile**, **web**, or **desktop** applications, helping to define clear goals before writing any code.

Working on this project allowed me to strengthen and refine my skills in **TypeScript** and **React**.

You can try the application at [quickmock.net](https://quickmock.net) and explore the code in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lemoncode/quickmock).
