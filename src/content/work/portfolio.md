**Built with Performance and Maintainability in Mind:**

This portfolio leverages the power of Astro, a modern web framework known for its lightning-fast performance and focus on content.  Astro utilizes components written in TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, ensuring code clarity and catching errors early in the development process.

**Key Benefits:**

- Blazing-fast loading times: Astro prioritizes performance, delivering a smooth user experience for visitors.
- Content-driven approach: Astro simplifies content management thanks to its support for Markdown and other file-based formats.
- Type safety with TypeScript: TypeScript's static typing reduces runtime errors and improves code maintainability.
