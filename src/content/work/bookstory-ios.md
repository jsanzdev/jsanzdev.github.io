## Calling all bookworms!

I built a mobile bookstore app using SwiftUI and Swift to elevate your reading experience.

This app taps into the power of a REST API, allowing you to:

- Discover new reads: Browse and search for books, from timeless classics to the latest releases.
- Personalized recommendations: Get a taste of something new with the "Latest Books" section, featuring curated picks from the API.
- Dive deeper: Explore detailed information and captivating covers for each book.
- Track your progress: Mark books as "Read" and maintain a separate tab for your literary conquests (data stored securely on the server!).
- This project pushed my coding boundaries!  I leveraged SwiftUI to create a visually stunning and user-friendly interface, making book browsing a joy.  Additionally, I explored the power of APIs to retrieve rich book data and implement a seamless reading progress tracking system.
